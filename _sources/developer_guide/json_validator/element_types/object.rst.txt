Object Type
===========

The '**object**' type represents a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings and values can be of any type.


Specific Fields
"""""""""""""""

**********
properties
**********

    .. warning::

        The '**properties**' field is required. The '**properties**' must be an object.

    Specifies the schema for the properties of the object. Each key in the '**properties**' object is a property name and the value is a schema that the property must adhere to.

*****************
patternProperties
*****************

    .. note::

        The '**patternProperties**' field is optional.

    .. warning::

        The '**patternProperties**' must be an object.

    Specifies a schema for properties that match a certain pattern. Each key in the '**patternProperties**' object is the name that represents the set of properties generated by the pattern and the value is a schema that the property must adhere to.

    The schema of the pattern properties has two possible fields in addition to the fields of the type to be defined, which define the pattern. These possible fields are the following:

        - **pattern**: Represents a string defining the regular expression that the property name must satisfy in order to be associated with the schema it defines. For more information on regular expressions, please visit the `C++ regular expressions documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/regular-expressions-cpp?view=msvc-170>`_.
        - **enum**: Represents a list of strings that defines all possible values that the property name must take in order to be associated with the schema it defines.

    It is important to note that only one of the two fields can be used to define the property pattern, both are mutually exclusive.

************
conditionals
************

    .. note::

        The '**conditionals**' field is optional.

    .. warning::

        The '**conditionals**' must be a list of conditionals.
    
    Defines a series of conditionals, which modify the base scheme. For more information on conditionals, see the :ref:`Conditionals of JSON Schema <conditionals-of-json-schema>` section.

*******************
patternConditionals
*******************

    .. note::

        The '**patternConditionals**' field is optional.

    .. warning::

        The '**patternConditionals**' must be a list of conditionals.
    
    Defines a series of conditionals, which modify the base scheme, in case of matching any of the patterns defined in the conditionals. For more information on conditionals, see the :ref:`Conditionals of JSON Schema <conditionals-of-json-schema>` section.

******************
requiredConditions
******************

    .. note::

        The '**requiredConditions**' field is optional.

    .. warning::

        The '**requiredConditions**' must be a list of conditions.

    Defines a set of conditions that are required by the scheme and that if not met will result in an error. For more information on conditions, see the :ref:`Conditions of JSON Schema <conditions-of-json-schema>` section.

*****************
warningConditions
*****************

    .. note::

        The '**warningConditions**' field is optional.

    .. warning::

        The '**warningConditions**' must be a list of conditions.

    It defines a number of conditions that are required by the scheme and which, if not met, will result in a warning. For more information on conditions, see the :ref:`Conditions of JSON Schema <conditions-of-json-schema>` section.
