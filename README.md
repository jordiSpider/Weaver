## Build

> **Warning**  
> All commands must be executed from the root directory of the project.

> **Note**  
> For users with little computer knowledge, a build project tool has been developed. For more information go to [Build project tool](#build-project-tool) section.

Cmake is used to automate the Weaver build process. Due to the use of Cmake, the build is cross-platform.

To define the different build types for the project, a [`CMakePresets.json`](./CMakePresets.json) file has been created, where the characteristics of the different types are defined.

To start the construction process, all you need to do is execute the following command:

```
cmake --workflow --preset <preset-name>
```

Where `preset-name` is the name under which the preset workflow has been defined in the `workflowPresets` section of the file [`CMakePresets.json`](./CMakePresets.json).

If you do not know which `workflowPresets` are available, you can run the following command:

> **Note**  
> This command displays the name of the `workflowPresets` along with a description of the `workflowPresets`.

```
cmake --list-presets
```

## Usage



## Tool script

In order to facilitate the use of the Weaver project, a script has been created consisting of a series of tools. The file is called [`tools.py`](./scripts/tools.py) and is located inside the [`scripts`](./scripts/) folder.

### Usage

<details><summary><h4>Linux</h4></summary>

In case you have downloaded the version of the project that includes the tool script executable, you can make use of the tools by clicking on the `tools` executable located in the root directory of the project.

Otherwise, the script has been implemented using Python. Therefore you can make use of it by executing the following command:

```
python3 scripts/tool.py
```

If the executable file is not available, you can generate it by running the following command:

```
python3 scripts/tool.py --gen_exe
```

For more details on generating the executable, go to the [Generate executable tool](#generate-executable-tool) section.

In case you have downloaded the version of the project that includes the tool script executable, you can make use of the tools by clicking on the `tools` executable located in the root directory of the project.

Otherwise, the script has been implemented using Python. Therefore you can make use of it by executing the following command:

```
python scripts\tool.py
```

If the executable file is not available, you can generate it by running the following command:

```
python scripts\tool.py --gen_exe

<details><summary><h3>Install dependencies tool</h3></summary>

<details><summary><h4>Linux</h4></summary>

This tool is in charge of installing the project's dependencies. These dependencies are defined in the [`project_config.json`](./project_config.json) file. For more information on how to define a new dependency, go to the [documentation]().

The dependency installation tool can be accessed in two ways. On the one hand by following the steps below:

1. Start the script as described in the [Usage](#usage-1) section.

2. Select the "Install dependencies" option in the action menu.

// Imagen de como seleccionar la opci√≥n

On the other hand, we can access it directly by using the `-i` or `--install_depen` argument.

```
python3 scripts/tool.py -i
```

Once we have accessed the dependencies installer, we can select the dependencies we want to install.

// Imagen de como seleccionar las dependencias

We can also select the dependencies directly, indicating the name of the dependencies separated by spaces, after the argument that indicates the selection of the action to install dependencies.

```
python3 scripts/tool.py -i build doc
```
